Guidelines, Rules of thumb.

Knock up each chapter

PDF uploaded to moodle
Including video of what we’ve done.

The page numbers are guidelines.
3 page methodology is okay.
Just don’t stray too far.

This is not a thesis.
It’s not really a dissertation either.
It’s a Project Report (more practical).

=========

## Cover Sheet
- college logo
- title of project
- title of degree programme
- name of team members
- name of supervisor / academic title
- submitted date
- Put third outside party in cover

## Table of contents
Table of Illustration (if applicable)

## Introduction:
Why it’s important
Why we chose it
It’s relevance
Set out objectives of project (in bullet points)
What is our project trying to do


## Methodology:
Whatever we did, we did it in a correct way.
We used the correct technique.
How did we review.
Why we chose certain languages, platforms, technologies, frameworks. (the only one I know is valid).
To learn something new or to get an in depth knowledge (or researching the best way).
Link 5/6 good resources, manuals, books, etc.
We will need to leave stuff out, describing a book chapter will take half to 3/4 of a page.
Biggest issue is how to square it into two pages.

## Technology Review:
We understand the landscape around the problem we are trying to solve.
Ionic, works with android, iOS, easily portable to web apps.
Why do we need to use it.
Tangental technologies linked to it, mongo, express, node, angular.
Talk about standards, briefly talk about them, here’s how they impacted the project (don’t critique the standards).
Diagrams included.
Need to say why we chose mongo over sql or pouch.
Reference everything.
Link in all the lit review stuff.
Technology Review would have most of the references.
Methodology might have a few references.
Include that that we accessed the URL (timestamp when it was generated). when referencing urls.
Use Latek.
Teklive

## System design
diagrams, url, etc

## System Evaluation
Show that system is robust. aka testing, junit
Highlight any limitations or opportunities (use a MEAN/JAVA stack backend instead of PHP because) (really hard to change the schema of sql compared to mongo).

## Conclusion
Briefly summarise your context and objectives (few lines).
Highlight findings.

## References
-IEEE format
Appendices
Source code
Installation Instructions (if applicable)

## Note:
Imagine an alien comes down and picks up your document, can he understand it?
The intro and conclusion should sum up the project, the inside is skiable.
